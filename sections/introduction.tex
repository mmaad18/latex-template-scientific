\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} file is intended to serve as a template for writing reports, articles, and books in \LaTeX.
The template is designed to be simple and easy to use, while providing a clean and professional look.
The template includes a number of common packages and settings that are useful for scientific writing,
such as the \texttt{amsmath} and \texttt{amsfonts} packages for mathematical typesetting,
the \texttt{algorithmic} and \texttt{algorithm} packages for writing algorithms,
and the \texttt{graphicx} package for including figures.
The template also includes some common settings for formatting text and figures,
such as setting the font size to \texttt{11pt} and the line spacing to \texttt{1.5}.
The template is designed to be easily customizable, so you can easily change the font size, line spacing,
and other settings to suit your needs.
